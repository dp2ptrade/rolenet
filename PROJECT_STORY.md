# RoleNet - Professional Networking App

## Inspiration

The inspiration for RoleNet came from observing a fundamental gap in professional networking platforms. While existing networks focus on industry-specific connections or general professional networking, we noticed that people often need to connect based on specific roles rather than industries. A teacher might need to find a graphic designer for educational materials, or a small business owner might need quick access to legal advice.

We wanted to create a platform where professionals from any field could easily discover and connect with others based on their specific roles and expertise. The vision was to build a truly inclusive network that serves everyone from teachers and drivers to doctors and architectsâ€”connecting people across traditional industry boundaries.

Our team's diverse professional backgrounds highlighted this need firsthand. We've all experienced situations where finding the right professional for a specific task was unnecessarily complicated. This shared frustration led to the core concept of RoleNet: a role-based professional network that makes connections intuitive, immediate, and meaningful.

## What it does

RoleNet is a real-time, professional matchmaking app that allows users from any field to connect globally and locally. The platform offers several key features:

### Role-Based Discovery
Users can discover professionals based on their roles, tags, and location. The app supports both nearby discovery using GPS and global search with smart filters for availability, distance, and online status.

### Smart Ping System
Instead of traditional connection requests, RoleNet uses a "Ping" system where users can send personalized connection requests with specific needs or questions. Recipients can respond by starting a chat, scheduling a call, or ignoring the request.

### Real-Time Communication
Once connected, users can engage through:
- Peer-to-peer audio calls using WebRTC
- Real-time messaging with support for text and media
- Group chats for team collaboration

### Professional Profiles
Each user has a detailed profile showcasing:
- Professional role and expertise tags
- Rating and reviews from past interactions
- Availability status and location information
- Service posts for offering professional services

### Service Marketplace
Professionals can create service posts detailing their offerings, including:
- Service descriptions and pricing models
- Availability calendars for booking
- Service bundles and packages
- Case studies showcasing past work

### Trust and Verification
The platform includes a comprehensive rating system where users can rate interactions, building a reputation system that helps establish trust within the community.

## How we built it

RoleNet was built using a modern tech stack designed for performance, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility:

### Frontend
- **React Native with Expo**: For cross-platform mobile development
- **Expo Router**: For file-based navigation with web support
- **React Native Paper**: For consistent UI components
- **Zustand**: For lightweight, efficient state management
- **React Native Reanimated**: For smooth, performant animations
- **Lucide React Native**: For consistent iconography

### Backend
- **Supabase**: For authentication, database, storage, and real-time features
- **PostgreSQL**: As the primary database with Row Level Security
- **Supabase Edge Functions**: For serverless backend logic
- **Supabase Realtime**: For real-time messaging and notifications

### Communication
- **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer audio calls
- **Supabase Realtime**: For signaling and real-time updates
- **Expo Notifications**: For push notifications

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **ESLint & Prettier**: For code quality and consistency
- **Expo EAS Build**: For CI/CD and app distribution

The architecture follows a modular approach with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Stores Layer**: Zustand stores for state management
2. **Services Layer**: API services for backend communication
3. **Components Layer**: Reusable UI components
4. **Screens Layer**: Screen components and navigation
5. **Utilities Layer**: Helper functions and utilities

We implemented several performance optimizations including:
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Virtualized lists for efficient rendering
- Debounced inputs for better user experience
- Optimistic UI updates for faster perceived performance

## Challenges we ran into

Building RoleNet presented several significant challenges:

### Real-Time Communication
Implementing WebRTC for peer-to-peer calls was particularly challenging. We faced issues with NAT traversal, signaling, and ensuring reliable connections across different network conditions. We solved this by implementing TURN server support and creating a robust signaling mechanism using Supabase Realtime.

### Offline Support
Creating a seamless experience for users with intermittent connectivity required significant effort. We implemented a sophisticated offline queue system for messages and actions, with background synchronization when connectivity is restored.

### Performance Optimization
As the app grew in complexity, we encountered performance issues, particularly with real-time subscriptions and large lists. We implemented connection pooling, throttled updates, and optimized rendering to maintain smooth performance even with many active connections.

### Cross-Platform Consistency
Ensuring a consistent experience across iOS, Android, and Web platforms required careful planning and platform-specific adaptations. We created responsive components that adapt to different screen sizes and platform capabilities.

### Database Schema Design
Designing a flexible yet efficient database schema that could handle various relationship types (friends, pings, calls, chats) while maintaining performance was challenging. We implemented a comprehensive schema with proper indexing and Row Level Security policies.

### Push Notifications
Setting up reliable push notifications across platforms required integrating with multiple services and handling various edge cases. We created a centralized notification system using Supabase Edge Functions to manage this complexity.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges, we achieved several significant milestones:

### Comprehensive Offline Support
We built a robust offline-first architecture that allows users to continue using the app even without an internet connection. Messages are queued locally and synchronized when connectivity is restored, providing a seamless experience.

### Performant Real-Time Features
We successfully implemented real-time messaging, calling, and status updates that work efficiently even on lower-end devices. Our optimization techniques ensure that the app remains responsive even with numerous active subscriptions.
